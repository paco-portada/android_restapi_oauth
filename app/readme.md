<h1>Android Rest client with Oauth2</h1>

<h3>
    A Android Rest client using a custom OAuth2 authentication.
</h3>

<p>This project uses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Oauth2</li>
    <li>Dagger2</li>
    <li>Retrofit</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The client was created considering a RestApi server created with
    <a href="https://spring.io/"><strong>Spring</strong></a>
    and its particularities. The server on which this project depends on
    was originally created by <em>WebSystique</em>.
</p>

<p>
    Take a look at <em>WebSystique</em> tutorial about how to
    <a href="http://websystique.com/spring-security/secure-spring-rest-api-using-oauth2/"></a>
    <strong>Secure Spring REST API using OAuth2</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Take into consideration that this project could improve its security.
    I'm was aiming just on the core functionality of a custom Oauth2 system.
